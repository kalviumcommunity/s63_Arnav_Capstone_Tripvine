Travel Stories – A Social Travel Experience Platform
1. Project Overview
Travel Stories is an interactive web platform designed for travelers to share their adventures, log activities, rate destinations, and discover new places through community-driven experiences. Users can browse stories, plan trips using a built-in calendar, and engage with other travelers for insights and recommendations. The platform creates a travel diary that not only helps users document their journeys but also assists others in planning better trips by leveraging shared experiences.
